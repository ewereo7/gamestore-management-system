## Games Store Management System

This project was developed as part of the Introduction to Programming and Databases module at **Loughborough University**, where it achieved a final grade of **95%**.

The system simulates a real-world games store, allowing a store manager to manage board and video game inventory, handle customer rentals, and book in-store gaming sessions using Python.

### Key Features
- Search functionality for board games and video games by title and genre
- Game rental system with subscription validation
- Booking system for in-store gaming sessions with capacity limits
- Game return processing with customer feedback collection
- Inventory pruning based on rental frequency analysis
- Text-file–based database system for persistent storage
- Menu-driven interface built using IPyWidgets in Google Colab

### Technical Details
- Language: Python
- Environment: Google Colab (Jupyter Notebook)
- Data Storage: Delimited text files (no SQL or classes used)
- GUI: IPyWidgets
- Visualisation: Matplotlib
- External modules used for subscription validation and feedback management

### Learning Outcomes
This project demonstrates:
- Strong procedural Python programming skills
- File-based database design and manipulation
- Input validation and error handling
- Modular program design
- Basic data analysis and visualisation
- Writing clean, readable, and well-documented code

This repository is intended for **educational and portfolio purposes**.
